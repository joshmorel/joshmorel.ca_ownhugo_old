Welcome to my blog and portfolio, a site built with Hugo and my own custom but evolving theme.

The earlier posts follow my beginner experiences in programming and system administration with step-by-step walkthroughs. Topics included creating a blog with the static site generators Pelican and Hugo, maintaining a Nextcloud instance, Node.js version and virtual environment management and using Vimwiki.

In 2019 I plan to focus my writing on a comparative journey in setting up a Content Management System with complex requirements using the many options available now including a traditional WordPress deploy, JAMstacks, and hosted options.
