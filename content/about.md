I'm Josh - a technology professional and enthusiast working in the
healthcare sector.

My interests and skills are broad and include:

* Open source software & the surrounding community
* Programming, dev-ops, system administration
* Python, Git, Linux, GNU, Postgres, MariaDB, R, & more
* Health informatics, quality improvement, business analysis
* Big data and artificial intelligence
* Blockchain technologies

The purpose of this site is to provide tutorials on the exploration,
development and implementation of different technologies. The main
objective is to entrench what I learn while providing a useful reference
for my future self and perhaps hopefully others.
